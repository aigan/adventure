# Current Work

## Active Plan

- **Exposure Metadata** - Add observation modality metadata to support perception system ([plan](docs/plans/exposure-metadata.md))

## Workflow

When working on features:

1. **Start**: Create plan in `docs/plans/`, update CURRENT.md to point to it
2. **During**: Track progress with checkboxes in the plan file
3. **Complete**: Mark plan complete, add summary to CHANGELOG.md with date, update CURRENT.md to next plan

See existing plans in `docs/plans/` for format examples.
