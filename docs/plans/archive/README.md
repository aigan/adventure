### Client-Worker Message Protocol Foundation

**Completed plans:**
- `client-worker-foundation.md` - Master tracking document for message protocol work
- `refactor-complete-locus-topic.md` - GUI terminology refactor (Topic → Locus, subject → topic)
- `automated-testing.md` - Message protocol test creation
- `message-formats.md` - Message format documentation
- `gui-requirements.md` - GUI data structure requirements
- `terminology.md` - Terminology clarification (Subject, Topic, Entity, etc.)
- `old-system-reference.md` - Analysis of lab/ancient-worker/ (historical reference)
- `testing-setup.md` - Manual testing guide (now superseded by test/.CONTEXT.md)

**Where the content went:**
- Message protocol documentation → `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` (Message Protocol section)
- Test documentation → `test/.CONTEXT.md` (Message Protocol Tests section)
- Implementation details → Working code in `public/worker/` and `public/lib/`

**What remains active:**
- `message-enrichment.md` - Deferred to later (stays in `docs/plans/`, after action handlers implemented)

**Status:**
- ✅ All Phase 1 & 2 tasks complete
- ✅ 367 tests passing
- ✅ Message protocol fully documented
- ⏰ Phase 3 (message enrichment) intentionally deferred
