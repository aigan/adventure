**What it is:**
A single-player systemic story game where narrative emerges from simulated agents and constraint-based generation, rather than pre-authored content. Think NetHack/Dwarf Fortress narrative depth meets detective game investigation, with Wildermyth-style adaptive story arcs.

**How it works:**
- **Agent simulation**: NPCs with memory, beliefs, planning, psychology
- **Wavefunction collapse for story**: Unobserved game state exists as possibilities, collapses to coherent outcomes when the player engages with it, constrained by story structure and existing threads
- **Multi-resolution simulation**: Abstract when unobserved, detailed when the player looks
- **Thread weaving**: Multiple overlapping story threads that connect based on what the player chooses to engage with

**Design principles:**
- Turn-based tactical gameplay with high stakes
- No failed quests - world adapts to player actions
- Detective/investigation focus with meaningful choices
- Immersive single-player experience

**Current stage:** pre-alpa
