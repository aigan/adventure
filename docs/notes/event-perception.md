Stage 1 Implementation Plan: LOOK Command with Perception Tracking                              
                                                                                                
Why Track Perceptions?                                                                          
                                                                                                
This is an investigation game where "who saw what when" matters. NPCs will later claim "I saw   
the hammer in the workshop this morning" - we need Event_perception beliefs to back those       
claims. The perception events become evidence/testimony.

Why three tiers? Later stages need:                                                             
- "When did you last see the hammer?" → Query perception events by time                         
- "Who saw the hammer in the workshop?" → Query perceptions with target=workshop                
- Conflicting claims → Compare perception times and learned beliefs                             
- Unreliable witnesses → Perceptions exist even if learned beliefs are wrong                    
                                                                                                
Implementation Steps                                                                            
                                                                                                
1. Add Event_perception Archetype & Traits                                                      
                                                                                                
File: public/worker/world.mjs                                                                   
                                                                                                
Add traits:

  observer: 'Actor',    // Who observed

  source: 'ObjectPhysical',  // Where belief came from (for learned beliefs)                    
  time: 'number',       // When observed                                                        
}                                                                                               
                                                                                                
Add archetype:                                                                                  
archetypes: {                                                                                   
  Event_perception: {                                                                           
    traits: {                                                                                   
      observer: null,                                                                           
      target: null,                                                                             
      time: null,                                                                               
    }                                                                                           
  }                                                                                             
}                                                                                               
                                                                                                
Why? Defines the structure for observation records that will be queried in later stages.        
                                                                                                
2. Modify learn_about() to Accept Source Parameter                                              
                                                                                                
File: public/worker/db.mjs, State.learn_about()                                                 
                                                                                                
Change signature:                                                                               
learn_about(belief, trait_names = [], source = null)                                            
                                                                                                
Add source to copied traits:                                                                    
const new_belief = new Belief(this.in_mind, {                                                   
  about: original,                                                                              
  bases: archetype_bases,                                                                       
  traits: {                                                                                     
    ...copied_traits,                                                                           
    ...(source ? {source} : {})  // Add source if provided                                      
  }                                                                                             
})                                                                                              
                                                                                                
Why? Links learned beliefs back to the perception that created them. Essential for testimony    
chains: "How do you know?" → "I saw it myself" vs "Bob told me".                                
                                                                                                
3. Remove Pre-existing Player Knowledge                                                         
                                                                                                
File: public/worker/world.mjs (lines 107-114)                                                   
                                                                                                
Remove:                                                                                         
const hammer_knowledge = player_mind_state.learn_about(                                         
  DB.Belief.by_label.get('hammer'),                                                             
  ['location']                                                                                  
);                                                                                              
player_mind_state.lock();                                                                       
                                                                                                
Why? Stage 1 test requires: "Player observes hammer, hammer belief created in player_mind".     
Player should start with empty mind, knowledge comes from LOOK command.                         
                                                                                                
4. Implement LOOK Command Handler

2. Learn_about after - Extracts knowledge with source link                                      
3. Lock state - Prevents further modifications to this snapshot                                 
4. Update player - New player version with new mind state

- Stage 5: NPCs with their own perceptions and beliefs                                          
- Stage 6: Time queries ("when did you see it?")                                                
- Stage 8: "ASK [npc] WHEN SAW [object]" queries NPC's perception events                        
- Stage 9: Observations of events (witness observations)                                        
- Conflict detection: Different NPCs, different perceptions, different learned beliefs
