Voxel based engine

* X-Z plane on planet
* Curved onto sphere from space
* Wrap away from player view

Sphere To Cube Transform; Project a planet relative position onto the cube (19:16)

Voxel regions
* 1 meter voxels
* 32m + 4m overlap = 36m * 36m * 36m
* Voxel size = 6 bytes. denisity and material.

Voxel Lods
* 6 lods. x2 per lod
* Subdivide regions
* Overlap at edges
* Non-unifrom density
* Lower lods in Y (height)

Voxel Region Octree (25:52)

Top-Down Generation
* Solar system
* Planet
* Terrain
