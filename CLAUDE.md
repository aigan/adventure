# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working with this codebase.

## Quick Navigation

- **[CURRENT.md](CURRENT.md)** - Active work and implementation plans
- **[docs/SPECIFICATION.md](docs/SPECIFICATION.md)** - Language-agnostic data model (what we're building)
- **[docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Current codebase architecture (how it's built)
- **[docs/STYLE.md](docs/STYLE.md)** - Code quality checklist (use after implementation)
- **[docs/ALPHA-1.md](docs/ALPHA-1.md)** - Alpha 1 detailed stages
- **[public/worker/.CONTEXT.md](public/worker/.CONTEXT.md)** - Worker implementation (primary work area)
- **[test/.CONTEXT.md](test/.CONTEXT.md)** - Test structure and utilities

## Project Summary

Systemic story game where narrative emerges from simulated agents and constraint-based generation. Think NetHack narrative depth meets detective investigation.

**Core principle**: No objective truth - only possibility spaces that collapse based on player observation.

**Current stage**: Pre-alpha (Alpha 1 Stage 1 complete)

**Primary work area**: `public/worker/` - See [.CONTEXT.md](public/worker/.CONTEXT.md) for details

## Development Commands

```bash
npm test                 # Run tests + linting (see test/.CONTEXT.md)
```

**Temporary scripts**: Use `tools/` or `tmp/` instead of system `/tmp` - keeps everything visible in project. (`lab/` is for user experiments)

## Critical Patterns

**Immutability**: Never mutate - create new versions via `state.tick({insert, replace})` with `base` inheritance

**Archetype composition**: Multiple inheritance via `bases: ['Actor', 'Mental']`

**Testing**: Every feature needs tests using `test/helpers.mjs` utilities

See [docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed patterns and [public/worker/.CONTEXT.md](public/worker/.CONTEXT.md) for modules.

## Code Style

- `snake_case` for methods/variables, `_prefix` for internal
- 2-space indentation, no semicolons
- JSDoc types only, minimal comments
- ES2024+ features, explicit `.mjs` imports

**Post-implementation**: Review against [docs/STYLE.md](docs/STYLE.md) checklist, update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with date

## Version Control

Project under Git, but Claude Code has no direct access. Ask user about Git history, branches, or conflicts when relevant.
